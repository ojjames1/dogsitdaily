Olivia is very calm and chilled with them and they clearly enjoyed their time with her — I received pictures and updates which was really helpful and they were clearly given the home from home treatment — so happy and a big thank you to Olivia xx”\n        \n      \n      Betty & Basil • Briards\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n        \n          Penka H. • Day Care\n          “Olivia was wonderful, I am so happy with her looking after Denzel on my wedding day. ❤️❤️❤️ I was relaxed and enjoyed my day knowing he was safe with her.”\n        \n      \n      Denzel • Jack Russell\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n        \n          Helen S. • Day Care\n          “From the moment we saw Olivia's listing, we felt so positively about her — she seemed so genuine and dog-centric. Happily, our first instincts were spot on; we genuinely couldn't have found a better person to care for Riley. He's such an anxious dog, and on the few occasions he has stayed with friends, it hasn't always worked out well. We were so incredibly lucky to have found Olivia — she is truly someone with a gentle soul, and our Riley instantly hit it off with her (which is a HUGE thing!). She was so patient with all the logistics of the day and adjustments to timings, never once making us feel bad about having to amend things. On the day itself, the photos she shared of Riley resting/playing or sleeping were so reassuring. We would not hesitate to rebook Olivia again — if she'd have our crazy dog again, that is!”\n        \n      \n      Riley • Vizsla\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n          Tolga D. • Boarding\n          “Theo had the best time at Olivia’s! Olivia provided updates throughout the day and put my mind at such ease (with having an anxious dog). He was so well looked after and had a great time hanging out with Olivia. 1000/10 would highly recommend ⭐.”\n        \n      \n      Theo • Cockapoo\n    \n    \n        \n      \n        \n        \n          Martha M. • Day Care\n          “Olivia was amazing with Milo. She sent me videos/pics of Milo & updated me throughout the day. You can tell how much care and love she puts into caring for dogs. I would highly recommend Olivia!”\n        \n      \n      Milo • Chihuahua\n    \n    \n            \n      \n        \n        \n          Jade A. • Boarding\n          “Olivia was so amazing with my lab Cassie. She settled in very quickly and came home happy, calm, and clearly well cared for. I really appreciated the regular updates and photos – it was lovely to see how relaxed Cassie was while I was away. I’d definitely recommend Olivia to anyone looking for a caring and reliable dog sitter. Thank you again!”\n        \n      \n      Cassie • Labrador Retriever\n    \n    \n                \n      \n        \n        \n          Marcella H. • Day Care\n          “I left my dog with Olivia today for 12 hours and was so anxious but Olivia was so nice and welcoming to both me and my dog. She sent me pictures all throughout the day and stayed in regular contact. I definitely recommend her !!!”\n        \n      \n      Bear • Rottweiler/German Shepherd\n    \n    \n                    \n      \n        \n        \n          Bethany M. • Boarding\n          “Olivia was incredible with Mili!

We will keep Olivia our first choice on our next sitter arrangements.”\n        \n      \n      Malibu • Alaskan Malamute\n    \n    \n                                \n      \n        \n        \n          Alexandra D. • Day Care\n          “I thoroughly recommend Olivia.

She kept in touch throughout the day and he had a few sneaky naps on her couch! I recommend her and intend to use her again”\n        \n      \n      Rocco • Labrador Retriever\n    \n    \n                                        \n      \n        \n        \n          Boonnie B. • Boarding\n          “Olivia was beyond fabulous.

    "text": "Hi, I’m Olivia — dog sitter and founder of Dog Sit Daily. I’m a calm, detail-oriented carer who treats every dog like my own. I don't currently have any dogs of my own at home but dog sitting is a service I previously relied on, so I understand how life-changing it is to have someone you truly trust looking after your dog — especially if they have separation anxiety!\n\n    Whether your dog needs a walk, a cosy place to stay, I’ll be your dog's best friend while you're away. I’m experienced with puppies through seniors, including nervous and anxious dogs. I’ve learned from group classes and 1:1 training, and I’m big on clear routines, enrichment and gentle confidence-building. Every dog is different — my goal is for yours to feel safe, relaxed and happy from the moment they arrive.\n    \n     I live in a relaxed, calm home with a secure garden. If your dog has specific needs — medication, crate training, recall work, or feeding routines — I’ll always follow your plan so they feel safe and understood.\n  \n  \n  \n  Have a look at my reviews →\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Approach\n\n\n✔️ Walks tailored to age and energy — even on rainy days!\n✔️ Small numbers only — quality over quantity\n✔️ Honest, regular updates (photos, messages, progress notes)\n✔️ First-aid aware and fully insured with Petplan\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Reel 📸\n\n\n\n  ‹\n  ›"
