          <span class="testi-quote">“This was the first time I have ever left my dogs with someone that they don't know but the experience was absolutely brilliant. Olivia is very calm and chilled with them and they clearly enjoyed their time with her — I received pictures and updates which was really helpful and they were clearly given the home from home treatment — so happy and a big thank you to Olivia xx”</span>

          <span class="testi-quote">“From the moment we saw Olivia's listing, we felt so positively about her — she seemed so genuine and dog-centric. Happily, our first instincts were spot on; we genuinely couldn't have found a better person to care for Riley. He's such an anxious dog, and on the few occasions he has stayed with friends, it hasn't always worked out well. We were so incredibly lucky to have found Olivia — she is truly someone with a gentle soul, and our Riley instantly hit it off with her (which is a HUGE thing!). She was so patient with all the logistics of the day and adjustments to timings, never once making us feel bad about having to amend things. On the day itself, the photos she shared of Riley resting/playing or sleeping were so reassuring. We would not hesitate to rebook Olivia again — if she'd have our crazy dog again, that is!”</span>
